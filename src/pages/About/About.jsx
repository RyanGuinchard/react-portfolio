          Hey, Iâ€™m Ryan Guinchard, a recently graduated Full-Stack Developer
          from Keyin College in St.John&rsquo;s, Newfoundland. With a passion for writing code, I spend most of my
          days working on projects, learning new technologies, and expanding my
          knowledge in the field of software development. I have experience working
          with JavaScript, React, Node.js, Java and more. I am always looking for new
          opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. When I&rsquo;m not coding, you can find me playing video games or spending time with my animals. Lets get connected and working together!
